# Utopia
Utopia P2P Built For Arch Linux

Since Utopia isn't fully open-sourced, you can't custom compile it. So I've converted the most recent builds into a format to install with Arch Linux. All builds will be 64-bit, unless there is demand for 32 bit.

# Installation Instructions

- To install the package, either clone this repo or download the .zip
- Extract it to your folder of choice. Open your terminal in the folder, or cd into it.
- Run the following command: ```sudo pacman -U utopia-*.pkg.tar.zst```
- After it runs, you should have Utopia installed and accessible from the app menu/installed list.
